### Q&A

* can I communicate with external systems in a stream processor (to enrich data) and is this a good idea to do so or would it be better to correlate a stream?
* how do I merge streams?
* how do I consume/query a KTables from outside? I dont want to input into a topic, it would lose it's table nature
* how do I properly measure the lag/latency & throughput btw in&out
* how to properly handle data reimports - new topics, new consumers, groups etc?
